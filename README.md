# Smart_Bin

The Smart Bin is a product developed by a team participating in the Eur√©ka 2022 scientific research competition. The team created a trash can that uses image processing to classify waste and deliver it to the corresponding storage location. The purpose is to make waste classification an interesting activity that everyone enjoys contributing to in order to protect the environment.
